There is also a data source from Data.gov which provides data on expenditures, income and demographic characteristics of consumers in the U.S. It provides it in different forms which I have accessed from here- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-expenditure-survey-dbf32 . These will tell me how much of income on average of a typical household in U.S. is allocated to clothing.\n2- The third data source is Statista from where I have accessed Average annual expenditure on laundry and cleaning supplies per consumer unit in the United States from 2007 to 2022 https://www.statista.com/statistics/305499/us-expenditure-on-laundry-and-cleaning-supplies/.\n3- To see the percentage of socks within the apparel expenditure, I have accessed- https://www.statista.com/topics/965/apparel-market-in-the-us/#topicOverview from Statista on the different categories of expenditure that make up the U.S. Apparel Market."

    "text": "Challenges and Errors:\nThe main challenge in this investigation to find relevant accurate data from surveys conducted. Collecting data on missing socks and their financial or economic impact is challenging. It is difficult to distinguish the direct impact of missing socks from other factors affecting household finances and amongst laundry-related variables like the types of wash, or the positivity towards wash. We are taking these as constant to avoid confusion. We also have to make estimations or take an average number in order to provide a clear pathway of cause-effect of only lost socks on current and future expenditure and no other variable. We make an estimation of the number of socks washed per week from the number of socks owned and take averages like the average price of all types of socks from CPI- Consumer Price Index.\nFurthermore, the dataset used does not specifically include a column for “missing socks.” Therefore, it is necessary to use proxy variables or devise a methodology to estimate the financial effect which we did through the sock loss formula.\nTo ensure the accuracy of results, we need to account for potential errors, such as missing or partial data in the surveys, and we extrapolate the survey information of an international audience into the average price of socks, average number of people in a household in US, the average total expenditure, we have to make an assumption to get a constant average number. We also have to figure out a way to take into account, from missing socks, the frequency of replacement socks in order to find an estimate of future expenditure."

    "text": "In the realm of Economics, where analytical prowess converges with societal dynamics, a persistent gender gap remains obscured. Unveiling this enigma necessitates an exploration of the glass ceiling and leaky pipeline phenomena, reflecting the artificial barriers hampering the ascension of women in the workforce. As we embark on this data-driven journey, the question lingers: what revelations lie beneath the surface?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe glass ceiling is a phenomenon that describes the existence of artificial barriers that slow down the growth of women in the workforce. These factors can be inherent such as the will for women to value personal life more than professional life with age, emotional inclination of women, or the social (gender-biased) conditioning such as the need to tend to domestic duties. They can also be external such as the gender pay gap, inequality in the workforce in terms of opportunities or the gender-biased discriminatory attitude of superiors towards their juniors in the field.\nThe leaky pipeline is a phenomenon that explains why women disappear as they move up the ranks in their respective fields like a leaky pipeline. There are less number of women at the higher ranks of different fields.\n\n\n\nAlthough this type of gender gap/inequality exists for other fields as well, the inequality is much stronger for economics than in other social sciences. Most researchers at current do realize that women are underrepresented in STEM fields and thus, required measures are starting to be put in place. There is very slow growth for the same in economics and researchers and the general public at large are not aware of the gap in economics and how slow the change is taking place. The gender gap in economics also indicates some general bias in science since economics unlike other social sciences requires and relies heavily on analytical skills and mathematics and statistics.\nIt is important to note this gender gap because it is not only for women in the field who endure sexist policies and hostile behaviour but even government policies would be different if more women were involved in the committees who formulated them. Some famous economists even mentioned that “economics is the worst field to be a woman in.”\nHence, the field is mostly dominated by men in terms of faculty members in universities or positions in banks, etc, relative to the overall population and relative to other disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph shows simply the share of women in different fields- these cover women in institutions like universities, laboratories, organizations, banks, schools, etc. We see from above that the smallest change is seen in the case of Economics and Humanities. We also see that the share of women both in 1995 and 2014 in the case of Economics is the lowest (hence, lower than Humanities in which also there is the smallest change). Business and Management also had about similar share of women in 1995 but it increased for B&M in 2014 but not that much for Economics. Hence, this is why the gender gap in the form of the leaky pipeline and the glass ceiling phenomonen must be studied urgently in the case of Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first visualization and the simplest one to highlight the leaky pipeline. Senior positions form a very small share of the total identified positions of women in Economics in different institutions. Hence, it shows that since senior positions occupy a very small share, as we go up, we tend to see less women in senior positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see a clear difference from the above line graph between the number of women at entry level and senior level. The slope does not represent anything. However, for discrete values, the reason why a line graph was chosen, was to show the difference in share at entry and senior level. The line of senior level can be clearly seen to be below entry level and if not for a line chart, it would have been difficult to visualize this, say with a bar plot. As compared to the previous chart, this further highlights the leaky pipeline since instead of comparing total positions occupied by women, the visualization directly compares women at entry level and women at senior level. Women at senior level is less than women at entry level since they have been leaked out of the pipeline.\nWhat we also notice here is that, the difference is the largest for the United States + Canada world region group. It is important to further explore this because of the economic position currently held by USA and Canada. There may be specific gender norms, government policies or country-specific confounder that may be causing this. Let’s further explore why is that.\n\n\n\nHigher ranked institutions may hire less women due to the pressures associated with the uptake of their publication record. Due to this and the burdens of parenthood, women may drop out of the institutions. The stakes are low at entry level since fresh male and female graduates should be having the same research potential. Hence, we must explore the following two expectations to understand if the difference in entry level and senior level share of women in the USA is not because of the greater number of top-ranked institutions in the USA if Expectation 2 turns out to be true.\nExpectation 1- Higher-ranked institutions hire women at a similar rate as lower-ranked institutions at all levels of seniority. Expectation 2- Higher-ranked institutions hire less women at senior level than at entry level as compared to lower-ranked institutions.\n\n\nFrom the above kernel density plots, we see a clear difference in the percentage of women at all levels. At the entry level, the density plot is spread out as compared to “All positions” or “Senior level”, and the peak of the plot for both the rank groups are at almost the same percentage of women at the x-axis. At the Senior level, the density plot peak for the top 119 rank group is more towards the left (lower percentage of women) than the lower ranked institutions which means higher ranked institutions higher less women at the senior level. Notice also that there is a general decrease in spread in both the plots at the senior level, showing less share of women in both type of institutions, further highlighting the leaky pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above visualization, we have kernel density plots for the percentage of women for two country groups for a closer look between Europe and Great Britain group and the United States of America and Canada group. Within each kernel density plot, we can see the difference between the top 119 ranked institutions and the top 120-238 ranked institutions. For Europe and Great Britain, the peak of the two plots at entry level are almost at the same point. For senior level also, the peak of the two plots are shifted to the left but are almost at the same point on the x-axis. For United States of America and Canada, at the entry level only, we see a stark difference in spread of the plot of the higher vs lower ranked institutions. Lower-ranked institutions higher larger share of women as compared to higher-ranked institutions in US and Canada at the entry level. A very interesting observation comes from the senior level graph- the lower-rank plot is now less spread which is according to the expectation of leaky pipeline but notice the clear difference in alignment of peaks of the two plots. The higher-rank plot is clearly more towards the left as compared to the lower-rank plot which shows that as compared to the Europe+Great Britain country group, at the senior level, higher-rank institutions hire less women as compared to lower-rank institutions in US+Canada. Hence, we see the existence of the previously explained ranking effect in the US+Canada country group. The situation appears to indicate that prestigious institutions in the United States set elevated expectations for their female faculty members not only in senior positions but also at the entry level. This phenomenon could be attributed to cultural distinctions and disparities in hiring practices within the academic job market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw in the previous visualization that ranking effects do exist and are stronger in the United States and Canada, as compared to Europe and Great Britain. But is it because of the more number of the best institutions located in the United States and Canada? According to the above visualization, we can see that US+Canada is better represented for the top ranked institutions (top50, top 100), and as we increase the number of lower-rank institutions to be included in consideration, we see that Europe+Great Britain is better represented (top 238). Hence, the stronger ranking effect in US+Canada can be attributed to the excellence in US+Canada in terms of the existence of more higher-ranked institutions in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw that in all countries (in the third visualization), the share of women at entry level is greater than at senior level. From the second visualization, we also saw how the proportion of women at all positions is much higher than at senior positions. We also saw the heterogeneity between the Europe and Great Britain country group and the United States and Canada country group. The differences may be because of the respective features of gender inequality in that country group/region. This is captured by the Global Gender Gap Index provided by the World Economic Forum. The dataset had ranks for each country according to the Global Gender Gap Index and had ranks for the share of women in all positions and senior positions. Now, the above visualization shows the correlation between the gender gap index rank of the countries and the rank of the share of women. There is a 41% correlation in the case of “All positions” and a 58% correlation for senior positions. The difference in the percentage of correlation, particularly the stronger correlation of the gender gap index (reflecting gender inequality values in respecive countries) and the share of women in senior positions, highlights that gender inequality is much more apparent in the case of senior positions, highlighting the leaky pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, I will also be adding an overarching flowchart with all information summarized similar to what I have on the about page-\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Social conditioning eliminated] --&gt; D(Output)\n  B(Gender pay equality) --&gt; D{Output}\n  C(More economic opportunities for women) --&gt; D{Output}\n  D --&gt; E[Economic growth potential]\n  D --&gt; F[Labour efficiency]\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Growth Potential:\nAccording to a report by McKinsey & Company, advancing women’s equality and reducing the gender gap in the workplace could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. There is a lot of potential in women who are getting educated and shifting to the workfield- it is important to recognize and utilize the potential to add to the labor productivity in the economy.\nLabor Market Efficiency: According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020, reducing gender disparity in the workplace can improve labor market efficiency, contributing to economic growth. This means that workers should be allocated based on skills, qualifications and merit rather than gender/sex, resulting in more optimum use of human resources. This efficiency will then translate into greater productivity and economic growth, because companies and industries will operate at their full potential.\nReducing Income Inequality: The gender pay gap remains a significant issue in all fields. In the United States, women earned about only 82 cents for each dollar earned by men in the year of 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The glass ceiling and leaky pipeline phenomenon often contribute to this gender wage gap. By addressing these two issues, we can actually work to reduce income inequality. By not holding women back in their careers due to social conditioning, by systemic changes in mindset, they can progress to higher-paying roles and it will have a direct impact on narrowing the gender pay gap."

    "text": "Week-11\n\nChanges from past diary entries-\nAfter a thorough research on finding datasets and data sources for Sockonomics Unveiled, unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find detailed datasets, meaning- the datasets I found were either about clothing and apparel and the expenditure on them, and not separate data on socks which is too narrow to find. The dataset on socks based on a survey I found had little information on “missing” socks. The most relevant variables were about the number of socks people have and the frequency of replacement. If I use these variables, to find out the number of socks that go missing in laundry on average in a week, I will have to make a lot of estimations based on the sock loss formula that has been established. Many variables there are not available and we can make estimations or assumptions on the variables, but making so many such estimations does not help with the idea of data exploration and visualization on the topic. The data available is too narrow and less to be able to explore or visualize. The sock loss formula has been calculated by Samsung based on a survey on laundry and socks they conducted- but the survey data has not been made publicly available. That was the biggest drawback and forced me to make many estimations about laundry cycles, laundry size, washing complexity, etc. Hence, the estimations and the variables I chose in the last week’s diary entry and the exploration I did was valid but due to so many estimations, it becomes very narrow a topic.\n\n\nThis is a new topic I wish to work on-\n\nFinding the right dog for you: Congrats! You’re a pawfect match!\nUnder this topic, I will delve into the evolving popularity of dog breeds and names over a ten-year period from 2007 to 2017, specifically focusing on data from the United States between 2007 and 2017. The primary objective is to gain valuable insights into the preferences of dog owners during this decade and unravel the dynamics of dog breeds and names for people to make their preferred choice before adopting a dog.\n\n\n\nImportance of the Project:\nCultural and Societal Insights: Understanding the changing preferences in dog breeds and names provides essential cultural insights and societal preferences- as societies evolve, so do their preferences, and these preferences reflect broader cultural shifts. Analyzing dog ownership trends can serve as a mirror to societal changes in values, lifestyle choices, and economic factors (maybe the popularity was based on price of raising?).\nCompanion Animals’ Role: Dogs have consistently held a unique place in human society as companion animals- they are a man’s best friend. Their popularity and the choices made in selecting a particular breed or name can provide insights into the evolving roles of dogs in households. Say, if a german shepherd is being adopted more, maybe the household prioritises safety by choosing a guard dog.These choices can reflect how dogs transition from working animals to beloved family members, influencing our choices and responsibilities towards them.\nResponsible Pet Ownership: The United Nations, through various agencies like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), emphasizes responsible pet ownership. Studying the popularity of dog breeds and names can highlight trends in pet ownership, which can be related to issues like breed-specific legislation, pet health, and animal welfare. It can promote responsible choices regarding dog breeds and emphasize the importance of providing the best care for pets. Many times because of an imperfect (or impawfect) match, dog owners in the US reduce their care on pet health and often times, even give their dogs up for adoption. The importance of finding a perfect match goes beyond aesthetics and comfort, but on compatibility to avoid disappointing results later since dogs develop symptoms of attachment and disattachment veru frequently.\nImplications for the Pet Industry: Changes in dog breed and name preferences can have far-reaching implications for the pet industry. From dog food and grooming products to pet accessories and services, the industry relies on understanding consumer preferences. Analyzing these preferences can help pet-related businesses tailor their offerings to meet the evolving demands of dog owners. This is much more relevant nowadays with even student entrepreneurs even at NUS, working on pet products.\nGlobal Perspectives on Pets: The United Nations recognizes the importance of pets and animals in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as promoting well-being and responsible consumption. By studying dog ownership trends in the United States, this project can contribute to a broader understanding of global pet ownership dynamics and their impact on sustainability and human well-being.\nThe datasets I have found are specific to US from 2007 to 2017. I will be taking two years to show how the popularity changed over a decade.\nWe will be focusing on dog breeds and dog names.\nStarting with the 2017 dataset-\nI’ll be using the variables of “Color”, “Breed”, “DogName”- with this I will be assessing the popular breed, popular color and the number of dogs with names starting with a particular letter.\nI will also be using a combination of the variables “Color” and “Breed” in the sense of the AND binary operator to find out which color and breed combinations are most popular.\nI will be doing the same for the 2007 dataset- and the visualizations will show the changes over a decade in the US.\nTo go deeper, I will also be assessing the variable “LicenseType”. This will help to show preferences for dogs more clearly.\n\n\nVisualizations to be used-\nFor Data Visualizations- 1) Popular dog breeds over time- I will be depicting the change from 2007 to 2017 using a line chart and also adding a trendline. Here, it is useful for me to use the datasets for years in between 2007 to 2017 to better depict the time series change. This will be a bit complex since there are different datasets. (I will have to create a new dataset from the existing ones.) But, I will be taking the top 10 breeds of 2017 (latest year available to me) and then assessing the popularity of those breeds in different years from 2007 to 2017. I will be having the “year” on the x-axis and the “Breed” on the y-axis. There would be separate lines for the different breeds and hence, we can clearly compare the trend. (categoric variable) 2) Popular dog colors- I will create two pie charts to display the distribution of dog colors in 2007 and 2017 to see shifts in color preferences. (categoric variable) 3) Color and Breed Combinations- I will use a heatmap to represent the frequency of different color and breed combinations. This will help me identify the most popular color-breed combinations.For this maybe, subpanels through facets can be used. (categoric variable)\nLayers of ggplot2 like labels, aesthetic mappings like colour- colour will be utilised to distinguish between different trendlines (colour in visualization 1). I can integrate these graphs in shiny app to actually show these changes by different years- the year will be chosen in the sliderinput. To do this, I can maybe change the graph where the slider input will adjust it by the width of year- number of bins but it would show by divisions of 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years. When the pointer hovers over any point on the trendlines, the exact number can be shown alongwith the year as well. It can be something like this-\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"1.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\nPie chart can be made interactive by adding a brief description when the pointer hovers to the piece of pie- the description can be specific to dog breeds within that colour.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"2.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\nEven the heatmap can be made interactive as such using Shiny-\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"3.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\nI wish to use Shiny to make a complete interactive dashboard which includes popularity on all aspects of colour, breed, License Type, name, so that users can choose any filter or adjust any filter they like and see the frequency of dogs according to that filter. I would also like to use Shiny for a whole comparative analysis between 2007 and 2017.\nI would use the sidebar panel to put in the filters there uaing sliderinput- of names of breeds, colours from cold to warm, types. If difficult, I would choose top 10 breeds or top 10 license types to narrow down filters. it will be a difficult undertaking so hopefully, with narrowing down, it will be a bit easier.\n\n\nConcepts-\n\nChoice of right visualization and using ggplot to create the line chart, adding trendlines for separate breeds, pie charts, heatmap - Week-7\nUsing the shiny app and customizing of the sidebar panel for the filters, adjusting of the slider input for the different values or names of breeds, type, colours, etc. All changes to the user interface and also, adding 3 dog images, using and learning from all examples- Week-8\nIntegration of Shiny dashboard with Quarto- Week-8\nAdding a new tab or page to Quarto Website - Self-taught\nChoosing a custom template on website for image and text with a divider like on my “Home” tab for the web page- Self-taught\nAdding icons embedded with links on quarto website- Self-taught\nAdding a flowchart which can be customised in any way on Quarto wesbite for summary- this will be an important summary aspect for my webpage- Self-taught\nMaking a heatmap- Self taught\nMaking a pie chart- self taught\nMaking a line chart with different lines for different breeds- Self-taught\n\n\n\nChallenges faced\n\nThe challenge that I faced mostly was with the integration of shiny app on quarto website. The errors were confusing. For now, I have integrated it. I was able to load the project again and the iframe tag started working since I specified it was html or block in the brackets after the ticks like ```{block}. After that, I am still getting an error due to python. I installed it and jupyter as well, but am not able to figure out where it is being used. Hence, for now, I have added proof of integration along with the basic placeholders/framework for the visualizations and write up.\nI needed to change my topic and it was challenging to assess if data is sufficient or not. I had to take the decision since data was too narrow. Hence, I had to redo the importance of the project, etc and find relevant datasets again.\nIt is difficult to find a way to combine different datasets together. I had to create a new csv file for the top 10 breeds of the years from 2007-2017 so that I have a timeseries graph showing the changes in popularity from 2007-2017.\nIt was difficult to learn how interactivity can be brought about- I searched for different graphs which were interactive so that I could have an idea of the possible ways to make it interactive- not in terms of how to do it but what features can be added. I have also added these graphs- this is the source- Yollin, B. (n.d.). Interactive charts in shiny. https://byollin.github.io/RInteractiveCharts/#20\nIt is difficult to combine the columns of colour and breed to take both into account together in the heatmap. For that, a new column must be created of colour plus breed and can be shown along years. What we can also do to fix this challenge, is take colour on one axis and breed on another axis on the heatmap- choosing a heatmap helps solve the problem to a large extent instead of getting complex with data."

    "section": "Week-12",
    "text": "Week-12\n\nTopic-\nAfter talking to the tutor and Professor, in order to make the topic more challenging to work with for more challenging scope and effort, I changed my topic to study the glass ceiling and leaky pipeline phenomenon. The datasets for the previous topic were clean and straightforward- I was able to use all the variables in 2-3 graphs and hence, I had either the option of adding more datasets for prediction or choosing a new topic. The topic of dog breed and colour popularity that I was working on had much less scope for any type of prediction and interactivity and even if there did exist scope, it was not very interesting topic to explore for the user or the viewer. Hence, I chose a more interesting as well as informative topic. My modified topic is as follows- The glass ceiling and leaky pipeline: Let’s talk about the gender inequality in the workforce.\nThe glass ceiling is a phenomenon that describes the existence of artificial barriers that slow down the growth of women in the workforce. These factors can be inherent such as the will for women to value personal life more than professional life with age, emotional inclination of women, or the social (gender-biased) conditioning such as the need to tend to domestic duties. They can also be external such as the gender pay gap, inequality in the workforce in terms of opportunities or the gender-biased discriminatory attitude of superiors towards their juniors in the field.\nThe leaky pipeline is a phenomenon that explains why women disappear as they move up the ranks in their respective fields like a leaky pipeline. There are less number of women at the higher ranks of different fields.\nI will be examining this question and phenomenon in the United States. I was able to find datasets for the country because the required survey has been conducted there for economics. I wish to explore the phenomenon for the field of economics. Although this type of gender gap/inequality exists for other fields as well, the inequality is much stronger for economics than in other social sciences. Hence, out of social sciences, I chose economics. The reason why I did not choose any field outside of social sciences such as STEM is because most researchers at current do realize that women are underrepresented in STEM fields and thus, required measures are starting to be put in place. There is very slow growth for the same in economics and researchers and the general public at large are not aware of the gap in economics and how slow the change is taking place. The gender gap in economics also indicates some general bias in science since economics unlike other social sciences requires and relies heavily on analytical skills and mathematics and statistics.\nIt is important to note this gender gap because it is not only for women in the field who endure sexist policies and hostile behaviour but even government policies would be different if more women were involved in the committees who formulated them. Some famous economists even mentioned that “economics is the worst field to be a woman in.”\nHence, the field is mostly dominated by men in terms of faculty members in universities or positions in banks, etc, relative to the overall population and relative to other disciplines. Why is this topic important (alongwith evidence statistics):-\nEconomic Growth Potential:\nAccording to a report by McKinsey & Company, advancing women’s equality and reducing the gender gap in the workplace could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. There is a lot of potential in women who are getting educated and shifting to the workfield- it is important to recognize and utilize the potential to add to the labor productivity in the economy.\nLabor Market Efficiency: According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020, reducing gender disparity in the workplace can improve labor market efficiency, contributing to economic growth. This means that workers should be allocated based on skills, qualifications and merit rather than gender/sex, resulting in more optimum use of human resources. This efficiency will then translate into greater productivity and economic growth, because companies and industries will operate at their full potential.\nReducing Income Inequality: The gender pay gap remains a significant issue in all fields. In the United States, women earned about only 82 cents for each dollar earned by men in the year of 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The glass ceiling and leaky pipeline phenomenon often contribute to this gender wage gap. By addressing these two issues, we can actually work to reduce income inequality. By not holding women back in their careers due to social conditioning, by systemic changes in mindset, they can progress to higher-paying roles and it will have a direct impact on narrowing the gender pay gap.\n\n\nChallenge-\nSwitching to this topic was difficult since it was difficult finding datasets for the above topic. There were statistics available but no full datasets but at last I was able to find. However, the datasets that I have found were showing up distorted and although different columns could be seen on the Numbers application of mac, the csv file that was being read onto r studio could show that it contained only one column.\nSince the data was separated by semi-colon, I used the following code-\nnewCol2&lt;- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, strsplit(as.character(new2_data$rank_toplist;institution;country;identified_positions;senior_positions;state_time;institution_classification;female_ratio;female_ratio_senior_positions;main_data_set;world_region),“;”,fixed=TRUE)))\nHowever, once I started working on the visualizations using the data sets, I realized I was not getting the required graphs despite correct code. Hence, when I viewed the new datasets more clearly, despite using the above code, due to the blanks or missing values, the column values were mixing up into other columns. Hence, I decided to remove all the missing values. In order to not make my dataset smaller by deleting many observations with missing values, I decided to remove certain variables which had missing values which were making my dataset smaller but were not important- for example, since the variable “country” was already present, I decided to remove “state” since I was looking at the data country-wise.\nAfter cleaning the dataset as such, I was able to get a proper format of the datasets on r studio.\n\n\nVisualizations (description)\nI have in total 4 datasets.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"ss1.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"ss2.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"ss3.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"ss4.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\nFollowing are the details of the visualizations I will create using them-\nThe first visualization is the simplest one and it is not a part of the main visualizations I wish to create per se. It is just a graph to show why I have chosen the field of economics for my study-\nThe new thing I learnt from outside the class was to build a bar plot with bars of two categories side by side. I am yet to figure out how to differentiate them with different colours since I am trying it with scale_fill_manual but it is not working. I build a bar plot using the pivot longer function before using ggplot. This visualization will be using the dataset- sample_edited.csv. Following are the variables used-\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"economic.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"economic2.png\")\n\n\n\n\nInsert caption here\n\n\n\n\nThe second one is an important one- it will be a bar plot and it shows the identified positions of women in the different types of institutions such as university, bank, business school, etc. Hence, I have to group data by “institution_classification” so that I get aggregate number of “identified_positions” for each type. In this graph, I would also add the points which indicate the number of “senior_positions” within the identified positions which is also a new concept to learn. This will be interactive by converting the ggplot to an interactive shiny app simply. This visualization will be using the dataset 2- sample2_updated.csv.\nSince I am also focusing on the regions of Europe, US and the rest of the world, I want to show the same classification of “identified_positions” for each type of institution and the number of “senior_positions” in a bar plot as above but here, it would be showing the region-wise distribution of women. This visualization will be using the dataset 2- sample2_updated.csv. I also am trying to make this into a world map since it covers regions and gives me an opportunity to utilise a more helpful visual aid to show the distribution of “identified_positions” and “senior_positions”.\nThe third visualization will take all institutions and identify the position occupied by women- such as entry level, senior level. This will be a crucial graph to show the leaky pipeline and compare the female ratio, grouped by country region- europe, US and the rest of the world. This will be a line graph to show two lines of senior level and entry level, and the “country” on the x-axis. This will use the dataset 1- sample1_updated.csv. The variables used will be- “country” and “level” and “female_ratio”.\nThe fourth visualization will be two scatter plots with regression lines shown- the scatter plot is to show whether there is any relationship between the share of women in the field of economics and the gender gap index. For this I would use the 3rd dataset- sample3_updated.csv from where I will use the variable- “rank_gender_gap_index” for each country, form a new dataset so as to include the share of women in each country from dataset 2- sample2_updated.csv. In the dataset 2, I will have to group and sum “identified_positions” by the “country”.\nOne scatter plot will be as above, and the other one will replace “identified_positions” by “senior_positions”. This will further highlight the glass ceiling and leaky pipeline phenomenon by showing the general share of women for the glass ceiling phenomenon and the senior position share for the leaky pipeline phenomenon. Both of these plots will be simply converted to be interactive by converting the ggplot to interactive shiny visualization.\n\n\nMore challenges and errors faced\nApart from scraping the old topic to decide quickly on the above topic and finalising the visualizations, I faced the following challenges and errors-\nThere was a big challenge in integrating the shiny interactive app onto the quarto website. I tried putting {html} and {block} as well but r was not able to identify a symbol. There was an unexpected token “&lt;”. After multiple attempts of copying the code and writing it again and again, and sitting with the professor and tutor in the project help session, integration was successful but all of us have yet not been able to identify the error. We separated all other content and then tried it again and it was successful. We created a separate document for it also- an empty one, to remove all other codes + content, but it was still not working. There was a problem in the detection of the symbol. BUt, once we changed the other content and removed certain problematic symbols from the other content, we were able to solve the problem.\n\n\nNew concepts learnt this week and last week\n\nTo create a bar plot with two bars for each x-value to show side-by-side for two years\nTo use pivot_longer to create a graph in order to group identified positions by institution type in the bar plot and also, add points to indicate another variable- the number of senior positions on the same graph.\nTo create a manual flowchart on the quarto website- as follows-\nAdding a new tab or page to Quarto Website\nChoosing a custom template on website for image and text with a divider like on my “Home” tab for the web page\nAdding icons embedded with links on quarto website\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Right Intentions] --&gt; D(Output)\n  B(Right Actions) --&gt; D{Output}\n  C(Right Direction) --&gt; D{Output}\n  D --&gt; E[Minimum Effort]\n  D --&gt; F[Maximum Impact]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nThe next steps to be taken are to finalise the errors in graph which is coming in case of colours, for the first graph. They have to be made interactive once everything is checked for the static graphs. Going forward, since I was able to create the static graphs, as well as add the interactive placeholders by integrating the shiny app on my quarto website, the last steps are to just convert the ggplot to shiny and finalise my final writeup and the flowchart that I have added after learning myself, to summarise the concept that I am trying to explain. I wish to use more features of interactivity and hence, will learn more types of options to make it interactive in the next 2 days so that I learn new concepts outside of the class, apart from the ones learnt till now since right now, I have simply converted my ggplot to shiny directly in the simple way to convert the ggplots to shiny app."

    "text": "Why Economics?\nAlthough this type of gender gap/inequality exists for other fields as well, the inequality is much stronger for economics than in other social sciences. Most researchers at current do realize that women are underrepresented in STEM fields and thus, required measures are starting to be put in place. There is very slow growth for the same in economics and researchers and the general public at large are not aware of the gap in economics and how slow the change is taking place.\n\nThe gender gap in economics also indicates some general bias in science since economics unlike other social sciences requires and relies heavily on analytical skills and mathematics and statistics.\n\nIt is important to note this gender gap because it is not only for women in the field who endure sexist policies and hostile behaviour but even government policies would be different if more women were involved in the committees who formulated them. Some famous economists even mentioned that “economics is the worst field to be a woman in.”\nHence, the field is mostly dominated by men in terms of faculty members in universities or positions in banks, etc, relative to the overall population and relative to other disciplines.\n\n\n\nNobel Prize winners (women) for Economic Sciences"

    "text": "What is the change in the share of women (all positions) from 1995 to 2014 in major fields?\n\n\nThe graph above illustrates the share of women across various fields, encompassing institutions such as universities, laboratories, organizations, and banks, spanning the years from 1995 to 2014. Notably, Economics and Humanities exhibit minimal changes during this period, with Economics sadly maintaining the lowest share of women in both 1995 and 2014. While Business and Management, starting from around the same level as Economics, witnessed a modest increase by 2014, the persistent gender gap in Economics is clear. This graph underscores the urgency of studying the gender dynamics within Economics and delving into the phenomenon of the leaky pipeline. It also serves as a compelling rationale for my choice of the subject of Economics for my data story study. We will see if the leaky pipeline is actually related to the existing gender inequality in the field."

    "text": "What is the number of identified positions and senior positions of women by different types of institutions in the field of Economics?\n\n\nThis visualization serves as the most straightforward depiction of the leaky pipeline phenomenon within Economics. Notably, senior positions represent a disproportionately small fraction of the total identified positions held by women across diverse institutions in the field. This contrast highlights a concerning trend: as one ascends the professional hierarchy, the representation of women diminishes significantly in senior positions.\nHere, you can also see the distribution for specific regions by colour. The darker shades show higher frequency of women in total identified positions in different regions and the lighter shades show lower frequency. This gives the same insights as above but notice specifically the stark difference in the frequency for USA in both graphs. It drops by a lot for senior positions! &lt;/p&gt;\n\nHere is the distribution of women by senior positions in different world regions. The darker shades show higher frequency of women in senior positions in different regions and the lighter shades show lower frequency."

    "text": "What is the difference in share of women at entry level (fresh graduates entering the industry) and senior level by different world regions?\n\n\nWe see a clear difference from the above line graph between the number of women at entry level and senior level. The slope does not represent anything. However, for discrete values, the reason why a line graph was chosen, was to show the difference in share at entry and senior level. The line of senior level can be clearly seen to be below entry level and if not for a line chart, it would have been difficult to visualize this, say with a bar plot. As compared to the previous chart, this further highlights the leaky pipeline since instead of comparing total positions occupied by women, the visualization directly compares women at entry level and women at senior level. Women at senior level is less than women at entry level since they have been leaked out of the pipeline.\n\n\n\nWhat we also notice here is that, the difference is the largest for the United States + Canada world region group. It is important to further explore this because of the economic position currently held by USA and Canada. There may be specific gender norms, government policies or country-specific confounder that may be causing this. Let’s further explore why is that."

The stakes are relatively lower at the entry level, where both male and female graduates are presumed to possess comparable research potential.\nSo, let’s explore two expectations to understand if the difference in the share of women at entry and senior levels in the USA is because of the higher number of top-ranked institutions. If Expectation 2 is true, we need to delve deeper into the reasons behind it.\nExpectation 1: Higher-ranked institutions hire women at a comparable rate to lower-ranked institutions across all levels of seniority.\nExpectation 2: Higher-ranked institutions hire fewer women at the senior level than at the entry level, especially when contrasted with their lower-ranked counterparts.\n\n\nThe kernel density plots above illustrate a discernible difference in the percentage of women across all levels. At the entry level, the plot exhibits a broader distribution compared to “All positions” or “Senior level.” The peak of the plot for both rank groups aligns at almost the same percentage of women on the x-axis. Conversely, at the Senior level, the density plot peak for the top 119 rank group shifts more towards the left, indicating a lower percentage of women compared to lower-ranked institutions. This means that higher ranked institutions hire less women at the senior level.\nNotice: there is a general reduction in spread in both plots at the senior level, underscoring a diminished share of women in both types of institutions and further emphasizing the presence of a leaky pipeline.\nHence, our Expectation 2 turns out to be true. Let’s continue to explore further."

    "text": "Is the ranking effect responsible for the larger difference in share of women at entry versus senior level in the United States?\n\n\nIn the depicted visualization, kernel density plots are employed to analyze the percentage of women in two country groups: Europe and Great Britain, and the United States of America and Canada. Within each plot, the distinction between the top 119 ranked institutions and the top 120-238 ranked institutions is evident. For Europe and Great Britain, the peaks of the plots at the entry level nearly coincide for the point on the x-axis. Similarly, at the senior level, the peaks of the two plots shift leftward but align closely on the x-axis.\nNotably, in the United States of America and Canada, a marked contrast in the spread of the plot between higher and lower-ranked institutions is observed right from the entry level. Lower-ranked institutions exhibit a larger share of women compared to their higher-ranked counterparts. A compelling observation arises from the senior level graph, where the lower-rank plot displays reduced spread, aligning with expectations of a leaky pipeline. But also notice that a distinct misalignment in the peaks of the two plots is apparent. The higher-rank plot is notably skewed leftward compared to the lower-rank plot, indicating that, in the US+Canada country group, prestigious institutions hire fewer women not only at senior positions but also at the entry level.\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon suggests the influence of cultural distinctions and hiring disparities within the academic job market, emphasizing the existence of a ranking effect. The situation appears to indicate that prestigious institutions in the United States set elevated expectations for their female faculty members not only in senior positions but also at the entry level. This phenomenon could be attributed to cultural distinctions and disparities in hiring practices within the academic job market."

However, a pertinent question arises: is this phenomenon attributed to the greater concentration of higher-ranked institutions in the United States and Canada? Analyzing the data presented, it becomes apparent that the US+Canada region is more prominently featured in the top-ranked institutions (top 50, top 100). Conversely, as we expand our consideration to include a larger number of lower-ranked institutions, Europe+Great Britain emerges as better represented, specifically in the top 238 institutions. Consequently, the heightened ranking effect in the US+Canada region can be attributed to the excellence characterized by a greater presence of higher-ranked institutions in the region."

    "text": "What is the correlation between gender gap index and the share/number of women in the workforce?\n\n\nThe observed trends across countries, as depicted in the third visualization, consistently reveal a higher share of women at the entry level compared to the senior level. This pattern is corroborated by the second visualization, indicating a notable contrast between the proportion of women in all positions versus senior positions. The nuanced distinctions between the Europe and Great Britain country group and the United States and Canada country group may be attributed to unique features of gender inequality within each region.\n\nIn delving deeper into the intricacies of gender dynamics, the Global Gender Gap Index provided by the World Economic Forum becomes a valuable metric. This index assigns rankings to countries based on their performance in gender-related indicators, offering comprehensive insights into the share of women in both all positions and senior positions across diverse nations.\nThe dataset had ranks for each country according to the Global Gender Gap Index and had ranks for the share of women in all positions and senior positions. Now, the above visualization shows the correlation between the gender gap index rank of the countries and the rank of the share of women.\nExamining the correlation, a substantial 58% exists for senior positions, surpassing the 41% correlation for all positions. This heightened correlation, particularly in the context of senior positions, underscores the pervasive impact of gender inequality, vividly illustrating the challenges posed by the leaky pipeline phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, we saw why, where and how the leaky pipeline emerges- it is correlated as we expected to the country specific ranks of societal and institutional barriers and is seen more in higher-ranked institutions. Since, there are more number of higher-ranked institutions in USA and Canada, the leaky pipeline is much more apparent in those regions."

More top-ranked institutions in the above regions. - How: Societal and institutional barriers. Economics sees a stronger correlation with the overall gender gap index for senior level.\nActually related to the existing gender gap in the field of Economics since the correlation 1) is greater for senior level than entry level 2) the gender gap index ranks are based on existing gender gap indices of the respective regions\n\nIn Economics, the gender gap, exemplified by the leaky pipeline, persists, driven by societal biases and institutional barriers.\nData from 1995 to 2014 shows minimal progress, urging a closer examination of the glass ceiling inhibiting women’s advancement. The stark contrast in women’s representation at entry and senior levels, especially in the United States and Canada, prompts exploration of cultural and policy dynamics. Higher-ranked institutions hiring fewer women at senior levels raises questions about academic expectations. Linking these insights to the Global Gender Gap Index emphasizes the correlation between gender inequality and women’s underrepresentation in senior positions. This narrative will conclude with a call to action for economic growth through gender equality, stressing the need to repair the leaky pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Social conditioning eliminated] --&gt; D(Output)\n  B(Gender pay equality) --&gt; D{Output}\n  C(More economic opportunities for women) --&gt; D{Output}\n  D --&gt; E[Economic growth potential]\n  D --&gt; F[Labour efficiency]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overarching flowchart presents a roadmap toward eliminating social conditioning, achieving gender pay equality, providing more economic opportunities for women, enhancing labor efficiency, and ultimately contributing to economic growth. McKinsey & Company’s report projects a potential $12 trillion addition to global GDP by 2025 through advancing women’s equality—a testament to the untapped potential awaiting recognition and utilization in the workforce.\nEconomic Growth Potential:\nAccording to a report by McKinsey & Company, advancing women’s equality and reducing the gender gap in the workplace could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. There is a lot of potential in women who are getting educated and shifting to the workfield- it is important to recognize and utilize the potential to add to the labor productivity in the economy.\nLabor Market Efficiency:\nAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020, reducing gender disparity in the workplace can improve labor market efficiency, contributing to economic growth. This means that workers should be allocated based on skills, qualifications and merit rather than gender/sex, resulting in more optimum use of human resources. This efficiency will then translate into greater productivity and economic growth, because companies and industries will operate at their full potential.\nReducing Income Inequality:\nThe gender pay gap remains a significant issue in all fields. In the United States, women earned about only 82 cents for each dollar earned by men in the year of 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The glass ceiling and leaky pipeline phenomenon often contribute to this gender wage gap. By addressing these two issues, we can actually work to reduce income inequality. By not holding women back in their careers due to social conditioning, by systemic changes in mindset, they can progress to higher-paying roles and it will have a direct impact on narrowing the gender pay gap.\nIn addressing the glass ceiling and plugging the leaky pipeline, not only do we pave the way for more equitable workplaces, but we also contribute to reducing income inequality and improving labor market efficiency. The journey through the data underscores the significance of systemic changes, emphasizing the need to recognize and harness the potential within women to maximize labor productivity and foster a more inclusive, prosperous economic future.\nReferences-\nUnderrepresentation of women in the economics profession more … - PNAS.

As compared to the previous chart, this further highlights the leaky pipeline since instead of comparing total positions occupied by women, the visualization directly compares women at entry level and women at senior level (Senior level refers to full professors and associate professors; entry level refers to assistant professors and lecturers). Women at senior level is less than women at entry level since they have been leaked out of the pipeline.\n\n\n\nWhat we also notice here is that, the difference is the largest for the United States + Canada world region group. It is important to further explore this because of the economic position currently held by USA and Canada. There may be specific gender norms, government policies or country-specific confounder that may be causing this. Let’s further explore why is that. We will take the two major country groups of United States+Canada and Europe+Great Britain since they have the top most institutions and the greatest share of women by proportion in all country regions. They make up the highest share!"
