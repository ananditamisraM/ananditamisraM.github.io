    "text": "The topic that I have chosen is Sockonomics Unveiled:This investigation explores the impact of missing socks in U.S. laundry between 2000-2019 on household finances, shedding light on how this seemingly trivial, unrelated and very bizarre issue can affect both current income and allocation of future expenses of households in the U.S. We evaluate the decrease in current income and change in allocation of future expenses.\n\n\n\n1- The data sources curated so far are from Kaggle on personal expenditures in the U.S. by State from 1997-2019- https://www.kaggle.com/code/davidbroberts/us-personal-expenditures-1997-2019. There is also a data source from Data.gov which provides data on expenditures, income and demographic characteristics of consumers in the U.S. It provides it in different forms which I have accessed from here- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-expenditure-survey-dbf32 . These will tell me how much of income on average of a typical household in U.S. is allocated to clothing.\n2- The third data source is Statista from where I have accessed Average annual expenditure on laundry and cleaning supplies per consumer unit in the United States from 2007 to 2022 https://www.statista.com/statistics/305499/us-expenditure-on-laundry-and-cleaning-supplies/.\n3- To see the percentage of socks within the apparel expenditure, I have accessed- https://www.statista.com/topics/965/apparel-market-in-the-us/#topicOverview from Statista on the different categories of expenditure that make up the U.S. Apparel Market."

    "section": "Challenges and Errors:",
    "text": "Challenges and Errors:\nThe main challenge in this investigation to find relevant accurate data from surveys conducted. Collecting data on missing socks and their financial or economic impact is challenging. It is difficult to distinguish the direct impact of missing socks from other factors affecting household finances and amongst laundry-related variables like the types of wash, or the positivity towards wash. We are taking these as constant to avoid confusion. We also have to make estimations or take an average number in order to provide a clear pathway of cause-effect of only lost socks on current and future expenditure and no other variable. We make an estimation of the number of socks washed per week from the number of socks owned and take averages like the average price of all types of socks from CPI- Consumer Price Index.\nFurthermore, the dataset used does not specifically include a column for “missing socks.” Therefore, it is necessary to use proxy variables or devise a methodology to estimate the financial effect which we did through the sock loss formula.\nTo ensure the accuracy of results, we need to account for potential errors, such as missing or partial data in the surveys, and we extrapolate the survey information of an international audience into the average price of socks, average number of people in a household in US, the average total expenditure, we have to make an assumption to get a constant average number. We also have to figure out a way to take into account, from missing socks, the frequency of replacement socks in order to find an estimate of future expenditure."

    "text": "Week-11\n\nChanges from past diary entries-\nAfter a thorough research on finding datasets and data sources for Sockonomics Unveiled, unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find detailed datasets, meaning- the datasets I found were either about clothing and apparel and the expenditure on them, and not separate data on socks which is too narrow to find. The dataset on socks based on a survey I found had little information on “missing” socks. The most relevant variables were about the number of socks people have and the frequency of replacement. If I use these variables, to find out the number of socks that go missing in laundry on average in a week, I will have to make a lot of estimations based on the sock loss formula that has been established. Many variables there are not available and we can make estimations or assumptions on the variables, but making so many such estimations does not help with the idea of data exploration and visualization on the topic. The data available is too narrow and less to be able to explore or visualize. The sock loss formula has been calculated by Samsung based on a survey on laundry and socks they conducted- but the survey data has not been made publicly available. That was the biggest drawback and forced me to make many estimations about laundry cycles, laundry size, washing complexity, etc. Hence, the estimations and the variables I chose in the last week’s diary entry and the exploration I did was valid but due to so many estimations, it becomes very narrow a topic.\n\n\nThis is a new topic I wish to work on-\n\nFinding the right dog for you: Congrats! You’re a pawfect match!\nUnder this topic, I will delve into the evolving popularity of dog breeds and names over a ten-year period from 2007 to 2017, specifically focusing on data from the United States between 2007 and 2017. The primary objective is to gain valuable insights into the preferences of dog owners during this decade and unravel the dynamics of dog breeds and names for people to make their preferred choice before adopting a dog.\n\n\n\nImportance of the Project:\nCultural and Societal Insights: Understanding the changing preferences in dog breeds and names provides essential cultural insights and societal preferences- as societies evolve, so do their preferences, and these preferences reflect broader cultural shifts. Analyzing dog ownership trends can serve as a mirror to societal changes in values, lifestyle choices, and economic factors (maybe the popularity was based on price of raising?).\nCompanion Animals’ Role: Dogs have consistently held a unique place in human society as companion animals- they are a man’s best friend. Their popularity and the choices made in selecting a particular breed or name can provide insights into the evolving roles of dogs in households. Say, if a german shepherd is being adopted more, maybe the household prioritises safety by choosing a guard dog.These choices can reflect how dogs transition from working animals to beloved family members, influencing our choices and responsibilities towards them.\nResponsible Pet Ownership: The United Nations, through various agencies like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), emphasizes responsible pet ownership. Studying the popularity of dog breeds and names can highlight trends in pet ownership, which can be related to issues like breed-specific legislation, pet health, and animal welfare. It can promote responsible choices regarding dog breeds and emphasize the importance of providing the best care for pets. Many times because of an imperfect (or impawfect) match, dog owners in the US reduce their care on pet health and often times, even give their dogs up for adoption. The importance of finding a perfect match goes beyond aesthetics and comfort, but on compatibility to avoid disappointing results later since dogs develop symptoms of attachment and disattachment veru frequently.\nImplications for the Pet Industry: Changes in dog breed and name preferences can have far-reaching implications for the pet industry. From dog food and grooming products to pet accessories and services, the industry relies on understanding consumer preferences. Analyzing these preferences can help pet-related businesses tailor their offerings to meet the evolving demands of dog owners. This is much more relevant nowadays with even student entrepreneurs even at NUS, working on pet products.\nGlobal Perspectives on Pets: The United Nations recognizes the importance of pets and animals in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as promoting well-being and responsible consumption. By studying dog ownership trends in the United States, this project can contribute to a broader understanding of global pet ownership dynamics and their impact on sustainability and human well-being.\nThe datasets I have found are specific to US from 2007 to 2017. I will be taking two years to show how the popularity changed over a decade.\nWe will be focusing on dog breeds and dog names.\nStarting with the 2017 dataset-\nI’ll be using the variables of “Color”, “Breed”, “DogName”- with this I will be assessing the popular breed, popular color and the number of dogs with names starting with a particular letter.\nI will also be using a combination of the variables “Color” and “Breed” in the sense of the AND binary operator to find out which color and breed combinations are most popular.\nI will be doing the same for the 2007 dataset- and the visualizations will show the changes over a decade in the US.\nTo go deeper, I will also be assessing the variable “LicenseType”. This will help to show preferences for dogs more clearly.\n\n\nVisualizations to be used-\nFor Data Visualizations- Popular dog breeds over time- I will be depicting the change from 2007 to 2017 using a line chart and also adding a trendline. Here, it is useful for me to use the datasets for years in between 2007 to 2017 to better depict the time series change. This will be a bit complex since there are different datasets. (I will have to create a new dataset from the existing ones.) But, I will be taking the top 10 breeds of 2017 (latest year available to me) and then assessing the popularity of those breeds in different years from 2007 to 2017. I will be having the “year” on the x-axis and the “Breed” on the y-axis. There would be separate lines for the different breeds and hence, we can clearly compare the trend. Popular dog colors- I will create two pie charts to display the distribution of dog colors in 2007 and 2017 to see shifts in color preferences. Color and Breed Combinations- I will use a heatmap to represent the frequency of different color and breed combinations. This will help me identify the most popular color-breed combinations.\nI wish to use Shiny to make an interactive dashboard which includes popularity on all aspects of colour, breed, License Type, name, so that users can choose any filter or adjust any filter they like and see the frequency of dogs according to that filter. I would also like to use Shiny for a whole comparative analysis between 2007 and 2017.\nI would use the sidebar panel to put in the filters there- of names of breeds, colours from cold to warm, types. If difficult, I would choose top 10 breeds or top 10 license types to narrow down filters.\n\n\nConcepts-\n\nChoice of right visualization and using ggplot to create the line chart, adding trendlines for separate breeds, pie charts, heatmap - Week-7\nUsing the shiny app and customizing of the sidebar panel for the filters, adjusting of the slider input for the different values or names of breeds, type, colours, etc. All changes to the user interface and also, adding 3 dog images- Week-8\nIntegration of Shiny dashboard with Quarto- Week-8\nAdding a new tab or page to Quarto Website - Self-taught\nChoosing a custom template on website for image and text with a divider like on my “Home” tab for the web page- Self-taught\nAdding icons embedded with links on quarto website- Self-taught\n\n\n\nChallenges faced\n\nThe challenge that I faced mostly was with the integration of shiny app on quarto website. The errors were confusing. For now, I have integrated it. I was able to load the project again and the iframe tag started working since I specified it was html or block in the brackets after the ticks like ```{block}. After that, I am still getting an error due to python. I installed it and jupyter as well, but am not able to figure out where it is being used. Hence, for now, I have added only one shiny app visualization to assess interactivity. I would be adding titles for visualizations on top and write-ups on bottom of each shiny app visualization.\nI needed to change my topic and it was challenging to assess if data is sufficient or not. I had to take the decision since data was too narrow. Hence, I had to redo the importance of the project, etc and find relevant datasets again."
