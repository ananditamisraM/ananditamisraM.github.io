    "text": "The topic that I have chosen is Sockonomics Unveiled:This investigation explores the impact of missing socks in U.S. laundry between 2000-2019 on household finances, shedding light on how this seemingly trivial, unrelated and very bizarre issue can affect both current income and allocation of future expenses of households in the U.S. We evaluate the decrease in current income and change in allocation of future expenses.\n\n\n\n1- The data sources curated so far are from Kaggle on personal expenditures in the U.S. by State from 1997-2019- https://www.kaggle.com/code/davidbroberts/us-personal-expenditures-1997-2019. There is also a data source from Data.gov which provides data on expenditures, income and demographic characteristics of consumers in the U.S. It provides it in different forms which I have accessed from here- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-expenditure-survey-dbf32 . These will tell me how much of income on average of a typical household in U.S. is allocated to clothing.\n2- The third data source is Statista from where I have accessed Average annual expenditure on laundry and cleaning supplies per consumer unit in the United States from 2007 to 2022 https://www.statista.com/statistics/305499/us-expenditure-on-laundry-and-cleaning-supplies/.\n3- To see the percentage of socks within the apparel expenditure, I have accessed- https://www.statista.com/topics/965/apparel-market-in-the-us/#topicOverview from Statista on the different categories of expenditure that make up the U.S. Apparel Market."

    "section": "Challenges and Errors:",
    "text": "Challenges and Errors:\nThe main challenge in this investigation to find relevant accurate data from surveys conducted. Collecting data on missing socks and their financial or economic impact is challenging. It is difficult to distinguish the direct impact of missing socks from other factors affecting household finances and amongst laundry-related variables like the types of wash, or the positivity towards wash. We are taking these as constant to avoid confusion. We also have to make estimations or take an average number in order to provide a clear pathway of cause-effect of only lost socks on current and future expenditure and no other variable. We make an estimation of the number of socks washed per week from the number of socks owned and take averages like the average price of all types of socks from CPI- Consumer Price Index.\nFurthermore, the dataset used does not specifically include a column for “missing socks.” Therefore, it is necessary to use proxy variables or devise a methodology to estimate the financial effect which we did through the sock loss formula.\nTo ensure the accuracy of results, we need to account for potential errors, such as missing or partial data in the surveys, and we extrapolate the survey information of an international audience into the average price of socks, average number of people in a household in US, the average total expenditure, we have to make an assumption to get a constant average number. We also have to figure out a way to take into account, from missing socks, the frequency of replacement socks in order to find an estimate of future expenditure."
