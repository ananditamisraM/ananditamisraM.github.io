\<Here are the examples of how the placeholders will be put- I will put the placeholders here and in each placeholder the visualization as in the tab of "Data Story Visualizations". In this textbox, I will be putting the description of the overarching topic\>


### Visualization 1

###### *Description of the question (brief)*

<Visualization>

Proof of integration- I was able to integrate before but suddenly, it started requiring python and jupyter- i installed the necessary packages, but was unable to integrate after that- no error also was showing up and hence, adding the image to show that i was able to integrate before
