title: "Placeholders Sample"

Integration of the Shiny App was done on the tab- 'Data Story Visualizations'- a sample to show that integration code worked for me.

\<Here are the examples of how the placeholders will be put- I will put the placeholders here and in each placeholder the visualization as in the tab of "Data Story Visualizations". In this textbox, I will be putting the description of the overarching topic\>

### Visualization 1

#### Description of the question (brief)
