## My intellectual interests!

\
Driven by a curiosity to study the intricacies of human behavior combined with my growing understanding of established theories of choice and decision-making, I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in research and analysis within the field.\
\
Passion combined with a belief in discipline, honest work, and regularity has made me strive for excellence and embrace every opportunity for growth. This kind of intensity has always made sense to me because these were the choices and resources presented to me since the beginning.\
Excited and ready for the journey ahead at NUS and beyond with the same values and to combine my passion with my personal growth to understand the choices and resources presented to other people that are different from mine.\

#### These are some of my media reps from school, along with my twin brother!

## A bit more about me

In less than a year, I have fallen in love with Singapore's environment in general and the positivity and satisfaction it offers to me as an individual. I love to write and read!
